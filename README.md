# EEG-Hand-Movement-Classification
Berlin 2003 BCI Competition - Channels were filtered in frequency domain and common spatial pattern (CSP) was used to whiten the motor imagery dataset channels.  

Various features were extracted using genetic algorithm and a neural network was designed. We achieved around 85% accuracy on the test data.
